RailsPandoc
===========

bridge to use pandoc as a converter for markdown to various output formats.

See http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html for more details about pandoc.
This is just a very basic interface, which doesn't support flexible options passing, etc.

It basically only supports markdown to (html or latex) fragment conversion.

Example
=======

markdown = "* a\n* list"

To convert some markdown into html use:
pandoc_to_html(markdown)
or the short alias: pan2h

To convert it to latex use:
pandoc_to_latex(markdown)
or the short alias: pan2l
